# **Complex Network Analysis**

This repository contains the notebook **`Complex_Network.ipynb`**, which documents the analysis, modelling, and visualization of a complex system using computational methods. The notebook provides a structured workflow for data processing, exploratory analysis, modeling techniques, and interpretation of results.

The notebook was created to study a subset of data from the "Gaia" space observatory, but it is easy to readapt it to other datasets.

---

## **📌 Overview**

The notebook includes:

* Description of the complex system under study
* Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual and statistical tools
* Implementation of computational models (e.g., simulations, regressions, neural models — depending on the project)
* Evaluation of model performance
* Visualization of results, patterns, and system dynamics
* Summary and interpretation of findings

The goal is to provide a clear and reproducible framework for studying complex systems through quantitative methods.

## **🛠 Requirements**

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

If your notebook also uses machine-learning or deep-learning components, you may need:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn tensorflow torch
```

(Adjust depending on your actual dependencies.)

## **▶️ How to Run**

Open the notebook with Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook Complex_System_Report.ipynb
```

or:

```bash
jupyter lab Complex_System_Report.ipynb
```

## **📊 Output**

The notebook produces:

* Plots and visual summaries of the system
* Quantitative metrics and statistical results
* Model predictions or simulations
* Interpretation and discussion sections

All outputs are generated directly within the notebook.

## **🎯 Purpose**

This project aims to:

* demonstrate a systematic workflow for analyzing complex systems
* apply quantitative and computational tools to extract insights
* show how modeling and visualization complement each other
* provide a clear, reproducible document for academic or research use

It can serve as a foundation for more advanced modelling or as part of a broader research pipeline.
