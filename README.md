# **Complex Network Analysis**

This repository contains the notebook **`Complex_Network.ipynb`**, which documents the analysis, modelling, and visualization of a complex system using computational methods. The notebook provides a structured workflow for data processing, exploratory analysis, modeling techniques, and interpretation of results.

The notebook was created to study a subset of data from the "Gaia" space observatory, but it is easy to readapt it to other datasets. 
As an example, one can find my report for this project and my results in the case of the Gaia dataset.

## **📌 Overview**

The notebook includes:

* Description of the complex system under study
* Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual and statistical tools
* Implementation of computational models (e.g., simulations, regressions, neural models — depending on the project)
* Evaluation of model performance
* Visualization of results, patterns, and system dynamics
* Summary and interpretation of findings

The goal is to provide a clear and reproducible framework for studying complex systems through quantitative methods.

## **🛠 Requirements**

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

If your notebook also uses machine-learning or deep-learning components, you may need:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn tensorflow torch
```

(Adjust depending on your actual dependencies.)

## **▶️ How to Run**

Open the notebook with Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook Complex_System_Report.ipynb
```

or:

```bash
jupyter lab Complex_System_Report.ipynb
```

## **📊 Output**

The notebook produces:

* Plots and visual summaries of the system
* Quantitative metrics and statistical results
* Model predictions or simulations
* Interpretation and discussion sections

All outputs are generated directly within the notebook.

## **🎯 Purpose**

This project aims to:

* demonstrate a systematic workflow for analyzing complex systems
* apply quantitative and computational tools to extract insights
* show how modeling and visualization complement each other
* provide a clear, reproducible document for academic or research use

It can serve as a foundation for more advanced modelling or as part of a broader research pipeline.
